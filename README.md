## Features of the Crash game demo

- **Realistic Crash-style multiplier**  
  Each round starts at **1.00x** and the multiplier climbs along an exponential-style curve until the rocket explodes.

- **Rocket animation and live feeling**  
  The rocket moves along the curve in real time so the demo looks and feels like a live Crash casino game.

- **Crash game betting panel**  
  Simple bet controls with:
  - numeric bet input,
  - quick chips (+5, +10, +25, Max),
  - auto cashout field (e.g. 1.50x, 2.00x, 3.00x, 5.00x).

- **Auto cashout and manual cashout**  
  Set an **auto cashout multiplier** or press the **Cash out** button manually while the multiplier is still climbing.

- **Virtual balance and stats**  
  All bets use demo credits only. The interface tracks:
  - total wagered amount,
  - profit or loss relative to the starting bankroll,
  - sample RTP based on total returns.

- **Round history and last multipliers bar**  
  A history table and “last results” chips show how often low, mid and high multipliers appear, just like in real Crash lobbies.

- **Pure front-end Crash project**  
  No backend, no external dependencies, no sign-up — the **Crash casino game demo** is a static HTML/JS app.

## Use cases: why this Crash simulator is useful
